# Variables

# Ways to store information on our computer
iq = 190  # We can now use this in our program
print(iq)  # Printing the variable we declared and instantiated before

# Best Practices
# snake_case
# Starts with lowercase or underscore
# Letters, numbers, underscores
# Case sensitive
# Don't overwrite keywords

user_iq = 150 # snake case,

# Constants
PI = 3.14
# __hihi = 9 # dunders

a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 # quick way for multiple vars

# Expressions vs Statements
iq = 100
user_age = iq / 5  # expressions produce values -> iq / 5, statements are entire lines of code that perform an action

# Augmented Assignment Operator
some_value = 5
some_value = 5 + 2
some_value = some_value + 5

# Neater way of doing this
some_value += 2 # Adds 2 to some_value
some_value -= 2
some_value /= 10
some_value ** 2
