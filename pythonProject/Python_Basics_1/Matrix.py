# Matrix -> 2D Lists -> similar to 2D Arrays in Java and C++
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
    ]

print(matrix[0][1])  # Same as Java and C++ accessing syntax

# Exercise
# using this list:
basket = ["Banana", ["Apples", ["Oranges"], "Blueberries"]];
# access "Oranges" and print it:

print(basket[1][1][0])
